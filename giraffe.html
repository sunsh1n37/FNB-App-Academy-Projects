                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The South African giraffe is found in northern South Africa, southern Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, and south-western Mozambique.
                   After local extinctions in various places, South African giraffes have been reintroduced in many parts of Southern Africa, including in Eswatini. 
                   They are common in both in and outside of protected areas. South African giraffes usually live in savannahs and woodlands where food plants are available. 
                   Giraffes are herbivorous. They feed on leaves, flowers, fruits and shoots of woody plants such as Acacia.</p>
                <p>The South African giraffe has dark, somewhat rounded patches "with some fine projections" on a tawny background colour. The spots extend down the legs and get smaller. 
                   The median lump of males is less developed.</p>
                <p>South African giraffes live in a fissionâ€“fusion society system based on factors such as sex, age, season, and kinship. This allows them to adapt to environmental changes.</p>
                <p>At present, the South African giraffe population is estimated at 37,000 individuals, showing an increase of over 150% over the past three decades. The IUCN announced 
                    in 2016 that it was moving the giraffe from a species of Least Concern to Vulnerable status in its Red List of Threatened Species report. That means the animal faces extinction 
                    in the wild in the medium-term future if nothing is done to minimize the threats to its life or habitat.</p>
                <p>South African giraffes are uncommon in captivity. As of 2010, there are around 45 South African giraffes breeding in zoos. Approximately 12,000 privately owned farms, ranches, and national parks maintain populations of this giraffe.</p>
