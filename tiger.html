                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, 
                    a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two 
                    subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>  
                <p>Tigers have been hunted by humans for millennia, as indicated by a painting on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India that is dated to 5,000â€“6,000 years ago. 
                    They were hunted throughout their range in Asia, chased on horseback, elephant-back or even with sled dogs and killed with spears and later firearms. 
                    Such hunts were conducted both by Asian governments and empires like the Mughal Empire, as well as European colonists. Tigers were often hunted as trophies 
                    and because of their perceived danger. An estimated 80,000 tigers were killed between 1875 and 1925.</p>
                <p>In most areas, tigers avoid humans, but attacks are a risk wherever people coexist with them.[228][229] Dangerous encounters are more likely to occur in edge 
                    habitats between wild and agricultural areas. Most attacks on humans are defensive, including protection of young; however, tigers do sometimes see people as prey. 
                    Man-eating tigers tend to be old and disabled. Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man-eating</p>
                 <p>The tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to 
                    perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range 
                    and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.</p>
