                <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. 
                It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg
                and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m  long. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being typically 10 to 20% larger than females. A thumb is visible on its forepaw, 
                which helps in holding bamboo in place for feeding. It has large molar teeth and expanded temporal fossa to meet its dietary requirements. It can digest starch 
                and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.</p>
            <p>In Ancient China, people thought pandas to be rare and noble creatures â€“ the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor 
                Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely 
                thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts 
                to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia.</p>
            <p>Pandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's 
                garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos. Chi Chi at the London 
                Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol. A 2006 New York Times article outlined the economics of keeping pandas,
                which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of 
                a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost. The last contract, 
                with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.</p>
