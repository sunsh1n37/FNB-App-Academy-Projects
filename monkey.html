                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. 
                   Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
                <p>Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group to the tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70 million years ago. 
                   New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the 
                   catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35–32 million years ago) are also 
                   considered monkeys by primatologists.</p>
               <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. 
                  Williams et al. outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.</p>
               <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 mm with a 172 mm  tail and just over 100 g in weight, to the male mandrill, 
                  almost 1 m long and weighing up to 36 kg. Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may 
                  contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).</p>
               <p>Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have long tails, with those in the Atelidae family being prehensile, while Old World monkeys 
                  have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all. Old World monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic, 
                  dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces 
                  of Old World and New World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.</p>
