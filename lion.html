                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>The lion is a mu
                    scular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in 
                    colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, 
                    which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The tail of all lions ends in a dark, 
                    hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm long, hard "spine" or "spur" composed of dermal papillae. The functions of the spur are unknown. 
                    The tuft is absent at birth, develops at around 5+1‚ÅÑ2 months of age and is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.</p>
                <p>Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a 
                    slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation 
                    in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.</p>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; 
                    a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than 
                    females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, 
                    and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.
                <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at 
                    night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to 
                    fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations 
                    in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the 
                    decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>
