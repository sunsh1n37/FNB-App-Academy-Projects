                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m, weights between 100 and 270 kg, 
                    and arm spans up to 2.6 m, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. 
                    The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. 
                    Gorillas tend to live 35â€“40 years in the wild.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous,[1] terrestrial great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
                    The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. 
                    The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, 
                    and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees.</p>
                <p>Until recently, gorillas were considered to be a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern 
                    lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla.There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, 
                    a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type 
                    of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other. Primatologists continue to explore 
                    the relationships between various gorilla populations. The species and subspecies listed here are the ones upon which most scientists agree.</p>
                <p> gorilla's lifespan is normally between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more in rare circumstances. At 68 years, 
                    138 days, Fatou is both the oldest living gorilla and oldest living female gorilla. The oldest male gorilla ever was Ozoum, 
                    who reached to the final age of 61 years, 24 days. The oldest living male gorilla is Guhonda, aged 54 years, 138 days.</p>
