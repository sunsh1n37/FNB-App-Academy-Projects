                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>The koala, sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
                    It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. 
                    The koala is found in coastal areas of the island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, 
                    New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large 
                    head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm and weighs 4–15 kg. 
                    Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller 
                    and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.</p>
                <p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has 
                    low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them. Koalas are largely 
                    sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males communicate 
                    with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. 
                    Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers' pouches, 
                    where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, 
                    but are threatened by pathogens such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and koala retrovirus</p>
                <p>Because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia. They were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths 
                    and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. 
                    Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description in 1814 although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, 
                    thereby introducing the species to the British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by English scientists. Koalas are listed as a vulnerable 
                    species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts, and 
                    associated bushfires, some related to climate change. In February 2022, the koala was officially listed as endangered in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland.</p>
                <p>For a mammal, the koala has a disproportionately small brain, 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only 19.2 g on average. The brain's surface is fairly smooth and 
                    "primitive". It does not entirely fill the cranial cavity, unlike most mammals, and is lightened by large amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. It is possible that the fluid protects 
                    the brain should the animal fall from a tree. The koala's small brain may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain.
                    Its small brain limits its ability to perform complex behaviours. For example, it will not eat plucked eucalyptus leaves on a flat surface, which does not match its feeding routine.</p>
